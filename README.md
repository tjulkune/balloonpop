# Balloonpop
Author: Tommi Julkunen
Platform: Android
IDE: Android Studio

Balloonpop is a simple game where you have to pop balloons before they rise out of the screen.
Balloons get faster over time. Missing balloons and popping evil ones reduces health.
The game engine is not finetuned but the mechanics work nonetheless.
Application is split into three activities: main menu, game and high scores.
High scores use the java file io on android internal storage.

Development has been restarted after hiatus.
