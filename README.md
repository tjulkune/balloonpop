Balloonpop is a simple game where you have to pop balloons before they rise out of the screen.
Balloons get faster over time. Missing balloons and popping evil ones reduces health.
The game is best played in vertical orientation.
Application is split into three activities: main menu, game and high scores.
High scores use the java file io on android internal storage.
